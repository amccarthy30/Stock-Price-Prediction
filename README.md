Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Network 

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is one of the largest technology companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. As a leading provider of software, hardware, and cloud services, Microsoft's performance is closely watched by investors, analysts, and market participants.

In this context, predicting Microsoft's stock price movements can be of great interest to traders, investors, and financial analysts. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that involves analyzing various economic and financial indicators, company-specific data, news events, and market trends, among other factors.

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting stock prices, using algorithms that can learn from historical data to identify patterns and make predictions about future prices. Machine learning models can analyze large amounts of data, including news articles, social media sentiment, and economic indicators, to generate predictions with high accuracy. However, stock price prediction is a complex and uncertain task, and machine learning models must be carefully designed and evaluated to avoid overfitting and improve performance.
